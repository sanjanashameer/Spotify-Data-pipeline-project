The Spotify Data Pipeline Project is designed to extract, transform, and analyze music-related data from Spotify, enabling insights into user listening patterns, artist popularity, and track trends. The pipeline automates the entire data flow, starting from data ingestion via the Spotify Web API, followed by cleaning, transforming, and storing it in a structured format for further exploration. Using Python, SQL, and modern data engineering tools, the project ensures scalability and efficiency in handling large volumes of streaming data.
